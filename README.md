Carry out the following practical and demonstrate your workings to the interview panel in whatever ways you see fit. 

Create a Postgres database to store information from the attached csv file â€“ first, decide which information you think would be useful for your machine learning colleague to use and only store this information. 

In a language of your choosing create a script that reads the file and pushes the information into the database. You will be expected to show your script and explain how it is executed. 

Describe how you would do this differently if you had to update the database with new records every time a new file is found in the directory you read from. 

Create an SQL query that gets all records (from your newly created database) after 2020 in an ascending order of project name. 

Please let me know if you have any trouble opening the CSV file.
